# Fun With Flags
A list of web accessible flags made with the latest HTML and CSS. The goal of this projects is to eventually provide a [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AAA compliant set of responsive flags created with modern web technologies. This project is also meant to raise awareness for the need of accessibility on the web, bring web accessibility professionals together and to educate about the meaning of each country's flag. It's just having some nerdy fun with flags. ðŸ˜‰
